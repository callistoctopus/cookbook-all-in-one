## Package java.util.regex Description
Classes for matching character sequences against patterns specified by regular expressions.

An instance of the `Pattern` class represents a regular expression that is specified in string form in a syntax similar to that used by Perl.

Instances of the `Matcher` class are used to match character sequences against a given pattern. Input is provided to matchers via the `CharSequence` interface in order to support matching against characters from a wide variety of input sources.

Unless otherwise noted, passing a null argument to a method in any class or interface in this package will cause a `NullPointerException` to be thrown.
